	You look at the beast, fearful of being devoured.<br>
	Never have you seen such a beautiful yet monstrous being. <br>
	The past melts away, what lies ahead is unclear. <br>
	Untold things may befall your kind on the track. <br><br>
	Such is the life of the R8, now left to the rich, spaghetti eating, car-magazine-reading dogs.
	The RS7 is faster, cheaper, and sleeker than her older brother. The macho R8 look like it
	spends 5+ hours a day sweating in the iron temple, but the RS7 brings in the likes of Channing
	Tatum to her sweet smelling bed without even a second of exercise. The sleek sportback, the 21"
	standard wheels... I'm being seduced just writing about it.
